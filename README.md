# NH Running Data Project
  A data analysis project that uses NH running road race data to answer some questions and perform an analysis of the running scene in New Hampshire.

## Goals of the Project

## Analysis Questions

## Data Source
  I have collected the data for this analysis from the public results that have been posted on the Millennium Running website. This organization is the most popular when it comes to setting up and running road races in the state and they host tons of races each year to provide a strong sample size to analyze. I have taken out the Name information to help keep the data anonymous. The results page can be found at the following link: http://www.millenniumrunning.com/2019-results
