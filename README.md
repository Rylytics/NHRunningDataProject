# NH Running Data Project
  A data analysis project that uses NH running road race data to answer some questions and perform an analysis of the running scene in New Hampshire.

## Goals of the Project
  The main goal of this project is to teach myself how to take various datasets collected and combine them into a single dataset for analysis. While I have learned the basics of python, I am using this first project to deepen my understanding of how the language can work in the data analytics space. 
  The second goal of this project is to get a good idea of what the running scene looks like in New Hampshire and answer the questions in the next section which will be driving this analysis.
  
## Analysis Questions
  To start working on this project with a certain scope the following questions were created and should be answered by the end of the analysis. The scope may change as patterns begin to emerge and I become more educated with the dataset, but this will be the starting point for the analysis.
  
  (Questions to be created and placed here)
  
## Data Source
  I have collected the data for this analysis from the public results that have been posted on the Millennium Running website. This organization is the most popular when it comes to setting up and running road races in the state and they host tons of races each year to provide a strong sample size to analyze. The results page can be found at the following link: http://www.millenniumrunning.com/2019-results.

## Author
  My name is Ryan Marshall and I am a data analyst hobbyist who is learning on breaking into the data science world. This is my first project to begin building a portfolio and hone my analytical abilities.
  
## In Closing
  By the end of this project I hope to have have gained a deeper understanding of how to use python to conduct a detailed analysis of a dataset and present the findings in a successful manner.
