# NH Running Data Project
  A data analysis project that uses NH running road race data to answer some questions and perform an analysis of the running scene in New Hampshire.
  
## Data Source
  I have collected the data for this analysis from the results that have been posted on the Millennium Running website. This organization is the most popular when it comes to setting up and running road races in the state. I have taken out the Name information to help keep the data anonymous. The results page can be found at the following link:http://www.millenniumrunning.com/2019-results
